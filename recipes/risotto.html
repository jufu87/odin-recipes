    <h2><strong>Gourmet Mushroom Risotto</strong></h2>
    <p>This mushroom risotto is cooked the slow and painful way, but-oh so worth it.<br />
    Complements grilled meats and chicken dishes very well. Check the rice by biting into it.<br />
    It should be slightly al dente (or resist slightly to the tooth but not be hard in the center).</p>

    <p>Risotto ranks right up there as one of the greatest dishes you can make with rice.<br />
    Originating in Italy, risotto is a recipe made by simmering a starchy variety of rice in broth,<br />
    with flavor-boosting ingredients added like onions, garlic, vegetables, meats, spices, herbs, and cheese.<br />
    This 5-star recipe for mushroom risotto has thousands of ratings and reviews,<br />
    and is a top-rated favorite for our Allrecipes community of home cooks.</p>
